# Fourth Web Technologies 2 assignment

# ⚡Using: MySQL, REST countries API, OpenWeather API, Google Maps API⚡
This is the fourth assignment from the Web Technologies 2 class. In this assignment I created a website that is able to
show me the weather of my current location by GPS or the location that I search for. The website also includes a page 
where I can see how many times each country has been searched for. This page also includes a graph of the time when 
people checked the weather.
## This project had a deadline so there may appear some bugs because of the time limit and my knowledge at that time
